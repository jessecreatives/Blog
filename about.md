**Jesse** is a designer & fullstack developer based in Minato, Tokyo. Trained as a Product Designer and with an MA in Product Design from The University of Edinburgh, I have been creating high-quality digital design works that are not only visually appealing but also economically and programatically performant for 7 years.

For the past 3 years, I have been particularly interested in UX design and Automation-by-Information-Techs. I developed several desiktop and mobile apps for my colleagues and I to automate part of our tasks so that we did not have to work overtime and could enjoy life a bit more.

I'm always ready to take on new challenges becasue I see them as opportunities to make myself, people around me and/or the society a little better. As a self-taught programmer, I went through quite some tough times learning new concepts or struggling figuring out others, but finally I got where I am. So I do believe that there really isn't anything that cannot be done.

> If you cannot change it, accept it; if you cannot accept it, change it. \<cite>Scott Adams\</cite>

I write basically about anything that is related to design, programming and technologies. When I'm not working, you would find me brewing drip coffee, practising Latte Art or watching a Liverpool FC match.

If you are interested in working with me, or interested in my works/blog posts, feel free to reach out by sending me a contact form via the [Contact page](abc.com).
